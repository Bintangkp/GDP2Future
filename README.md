# 💡GDP2Future💡 
This project aims to explore and do some analysis regarding the relationship between education expenditure (% of GDP) and education quality indicators, such as completion rate, dropout rate, and unemployment rate. Additionally, this study will examine how education quality influences the crime rate specifically on homicide rate. By understanding these patterns, this research seeks to provide deeper insights into the effectiveness of government investment in education and its impact on social well-being.
